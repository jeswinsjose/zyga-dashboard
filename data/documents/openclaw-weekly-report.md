## Executive Summary

This week the **Zyga AI agent** completed **14 tasks**, processed **3,200 API calls**, and generated **7 deliverables**. System uptime was **99.8%** with one minor outage on Wednesday.

## Key Metrics

| Metric            | This Week | Last Week | Change |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------- | ------ |
| Tasks Completed   | 14        | 11        | +27%   |
| API Calls         | 3,200     | 2,850     | +12%   |
| Avg Response Time | 1.2s      | 1.4s      | -14%   |
| Token Usage       | 48,500    | 42,100    | +15%   |
| Cost              | $12.47    | $10.80    | +15%   |

## Completed Tasks

### High Priority

1. **YouTube Data API Integration** — Built connector for channel analytics

2. **Security Vulnerability Scan** — Audited n8n workflows for CVE exposure

3. **Dashboard Performance** — Reduced initial load time from 3.2s to 1.1s

### Medium Priority

* Refactored document storage to use markdown with frontmatter

* Added auto-discovery for OpenClaw-generated documents

* Implemented 30-second polling for live document updates

* Updated CSS to match BlockNote editor styles precisely

### Low Priority

* Fixed typos in Zyga Master Guide

* Cleaned up unused test documents

* Updated README with new API endpoints

## Incidents

> **Wednesday 2:14 PM** — API server unresponsive for 3 minutes due to memory spike during concurrent document indexing. Root cause: synchronous file reads blocking the event loop. Fixed by switching to streaming reads.

> kjkjl

## Code Changes

```javascript
// Before: blocking read
const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8');

// After: non-blocking with proper error handling
const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: YAML Frontmatter for Document Metadata

**Context:** OpenClaw needs to specify document metadata (title, emoji, category) when generating `.md` files.

**Decision:** Use YAML frontmatter at the top of each `.md` file:

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
emoji: "📊"
category: "Report"
---
```

**Consequences:**

* *Positive*: Self-contained metadata, no separate config files needed

* *Positive*: Industry-standard format (Hugo, Jekyll, Docusaurus all use it)

* *Negative*: Requires server-side parsing and stripping before serving to editor

## Next Week Priorities

1. Implement real-time WebSocket updates for document sync

2. Add search indexing for full-text document search

3. Build cost analytics dashboard with daily/weekly breakdowns

4. Integrate OpenClaw cron job monitoring
